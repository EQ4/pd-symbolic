#X text 12 -88 [make_chord] expects incoming lists as formated by the
[midi_quantizer] object. These should contain at least three numbers
represeting (midi-tick \, midi-note \, velocity). It expect to receive
note-off messages as "note-on with zero velocity \, " following the
pd midi convention.;
#X text 13 -10 Its aim is to repackage individual midi notes as lists
according to their timestamp \, as if they where chords played simultaneously.
The object waits until an equivalent number of notes off is produced
to produce an output.;
#X text 13 50 WHILE THIS PROCEDURE SHOULD WORK WITH HOMOPHONIC FILES
\, A BETTER AND SAFER WAY OF COMPUTING NOTES SHOULD BE ADDED \, TO
DEAL WITH MORE COUNTERPOINTAL INPUT.;
