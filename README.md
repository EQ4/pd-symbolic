# pd-symbolic

Pd patches and utilities for symbolic manipulation of music.
Among the different components, we plan to include modules for harmonic, rhythmic and melodic analysis from text and midi, as well as generative tools on different musical styles, with a strong focus on Electronic Dance Music.

Review of the contents:

"absutils" --- folder that includes abstractions and utilities used elsewhere. These include distance metrics, and list manipulations, for example.
