# pd-symbolic

Pd patches and utilities for symbolic manipulation of music.
Among the different components, we plan to include modules for harmonic, rhythmic and melodic analysis from text and midi, as well as generative tools on different musical styles, with a strong focus on Electronic Dance Music.

Contents:

"abs" --- folder that includes abstractions and utilities used elsewhere. These include distance metrics, list manipulations, and other symbolic data handeling tools.

"demos" --- here we will locate elaborate and fully working patches.

"examples" --- the examples folder hold mid-level components, such as key estimators or rhythm analyzers.

"testfiles" --- a collection of midi and textfiles to run the examples and demos.
