# pd-symbolic

Pd patches and utilities for symbolic manipulation of music.
Among the different components, we plan to include modules for harmonic, rhythmic and melodic analysis from text and midi, as well as generative tools on different musical styles, with a strong focus on Electronic Dance Music.

Review of the contents:

"absutils" --- folder that includes abstractions and utilities used elsewhere. These include distance metrics, and list manipulations, for example.

"pitch" ---

"obsolete" --- well... its name says it all... patches that we do not consider to belong anywhere specifically, that suffered modifications or that we decided to keep for whichever reason.

"rhythm" ---
